This program mocks common Unix commands such as pwd, su, chmod,... It simulates a file system without affecting existing one on your machine.
The following commands are included: pwd, cd, ls, mkdir, exit, touch, su, cp, mv, rm, rmdir,chown, chmod, adduser, deluser (though only implemented at a basic level).
Open user.bat to start the program.
